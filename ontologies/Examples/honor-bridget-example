  "description": "Director of the Strangeways Research Laboratory, 1929-1970. There is very considerable overlap between this material and that in the papers of the Strangeways Laboratory (SA/SRL), in the light of Dame Honor's very long connection with the Strangeways from 1923; as Director, 1929-1970. Her important individual contributions to biology are discussed in detail in the Biographical Memoir produced by Dame Janet Vaughan for the Royal Society. She was also associated with a number of other bodies in related research fields and had an international reputation.",
