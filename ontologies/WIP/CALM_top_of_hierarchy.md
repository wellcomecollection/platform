#CALM record: top of hierarchy

line 25, Description
Backslashes used to "neutralise" the various quotation marks in URLs etc that would otherwise mess up the JSON

Line 28, Structure
Something in this big slab of text from CALM is rendering the JSON invalid and I can't see what it is - any ideas?

lines 30-105, Subjects
Something in the opening line of each subject - the "label" line - invalidates the JSON and I can't see why - any ideas?

lines 108-143, Languages
We need a type for these in addition to the label

lines 163-183, Accession numbers
We need a type for these as well as the value?

line 186, accessRightsStatement
