   *  1. For bibliographic records where "246" is popuated with "1" as the first indicator and a second indicator of "6" 
   *  2. Populate "lettering" with "246" a.
   *  3. If record is archive, image or journals look at 749 but not subfield "6". Need to check how we identify these records. Archive will come through CALM anyway

   * 4. If record is of type art then populate with "245" subfield "6". Dont know how we identfiy records as art works.

   * 4. For each "location" we get a code and name the code will match one from our list of locationTypes. "name" is used to populate our location "label".
