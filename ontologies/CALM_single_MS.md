CALM contains both RefNo (to build the hierarchy) and AltRefNo (to show to the user).
Both will presumably be needed.  At present each maps simply to identifier (=sourceIdentifier in the .ttl files).  
How to distinguish?
Also occurs with Item, below

How to distinguish?  In CALM interface only AltRefNo is shown, called "Reference"

I've concatenated here two fields from CALM.
"Extent" is a very top-level indication of how much stuff there is - "1 file"
"Physical Description" goes into more detail.
Do we want to separate these, as there's a fair bit of real-world overlap in how they're used?
