# JSON examples: a free-standing manuscript described in CALM

Comment, line 62
I've concatenated here two fields from CALM.
"Extent" is a very top-level indication of how much stuff there is - "1 file"
"Physical Description" goes into more detail.
Do we want to separate these, as there's a fair bit of real-world overlap in how they're used?
