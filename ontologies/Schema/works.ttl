#######  Classes #####  

wwork:Work rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Work"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "An individual work such as a text, archive item or picture; or a grouping of individual works (so, for instance, an archive collection counts as a work, as do all the series and individual files within it).  Each work may exist in multiple instances (e.g. copies of the same book).  N.B. this is not synonymous with \"work\" as that is understood in the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions' Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records model (FRBR) but represents something lower down the FRBR hierarchy, namely manifestation. Groups of related items are also included as works because they have similar properties to the individual ones."@en ;

wwork:Item rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Item"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "A specific instance of a work: for instance, an individual physical copy with its own location.  This corresponds to the bottom, Instance, layer of FRBR.  Works that are unique - that is, have only one copy - are described in terms of a Work for their intellectual content, linked to an Item describing their local (usually physical) characteristics."@en ;

wwork:Format rdf:type owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Format"@en ;
    rdfs:comment "Format is used to provide a detailed expansion of a WorkType, in terms of physical characteristics, rendering requirements or both: thus, WorkType would state that a work comprises moving image material, whilst Format explains that it is a VHS video."@en ;
