"""
Contains logic for building reindex shards.

A reindex shard is of the form "{source}/{id}", where "source" is the
name of the data source (e.g. "miro", "sierra"), and "id" is a shard number string
based on the ID.

The length of the shard varies based on the data source, to keep individual
reindex shards for each source at a manageable size.
