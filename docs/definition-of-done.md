# Definition of done

A task is "done" when all of the following tasks have been completed (or we've
agreed there's nothing to do):

*   We've spoken to anybody who might have an interest â€“ e.g. product owner,
    UX team, other devs
*   Change is tested
*   Change is documented
*   Change is reviewed (this is enforced by GitHub protected branch controls)
*   Change is merged into master and deployed
