# Code Reviews

Code reviews are intended to ensure code changes meet a high standard and to share best practise between team members.

Code reviews should:

- Be performed by a developer who did not write the code.
- Require approval from:
   - **one** other developer in the case of project work
   - **two** developers (one of whom is from a different team) in the case of library changes.
- Not block merging, i.e. changes can be requested in later PRs where that change is not critical to the purpose of the existing PR.
- Ask for clarification where code or purpose is unclear.
- Be polite: assume the good intent of the person making the change.

Some guidelines:

- Nit picking is okay but should be labelled as such.
- Code style, indentation, etc is better handled by automated linting than by code review.
- Developers from any team can comment on any PR that they feel qualified to (it is expected that this happen).
- The developer who opened a PR should be the one to merge it.
- Examples of how to structure code or links to resources that clarify are helpful.
