# Wellcome Collection Digital Platform

The Wellcome Collection digital platform provides a base for developers working within Wellcome to easily create, build, monitor and maintain digital services utilising Wellcome Collection resources.

You can read documentation for our APIs at <https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/>.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute Platform code with attribution under the terms of the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for details.

## What's the "Wellcome digital platform"?

> Wellcome are developing a new digital platform for Wellcome Collection, that will enable us to improve the experience we offer to readers and researchers. We also want to make it easier for third-party developers to build things with our data and collections.

> This means providing programmatic access to our digital assets, metadata and web content by developing a simple, unified and coherent set of APIs.

### Developing in the open
We intend to develop in the open, so that others can learn from our mistakes and successes. We  want to be transparent on the state of work in progress and provide a forum to raise issues and discuss our approach.

Everything we create will be open-source, under an MIT license. We will package things that are useful to others as standalone components, so that they can be easily re-used outside of our platform.

## Wellcome Collection platform developers

Developers who want to create projects within the platform should refer to our [developer docs](docs/README.md).
