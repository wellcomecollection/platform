## Pull Request process 

Here are some guidelines that we follow internally when submitting PRs:

- Open PRs as early as possible to provide visibility of work
- PRs not ready for final review should be prefixed "[WIP]"
- Developers should assign themselves to PRs they have contributed code changes to
- PRs should only be approved by someone who has not contributed code changes
- PRs should be merged by the assignees of a PR
- RFC PRs should be approved by all non-contributing developers in the digital platform team in order to be merged
- Developers assigned to a PR are responsible for deploying their changes after a merge
