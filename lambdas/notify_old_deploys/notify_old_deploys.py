Checks the DynamoDB deployments table for deployments with a createdAt date
older than the given AGE_BOUNDARY_MINS.

Publishes a message to a given SNS topic if any out of date deployments are
found.

This lambda is intended to be run on a repeated schedule of some period less
than AGE_BOUNDARY_MINS.
