@ApiModel(
  value = "Work",
  description =
    "An individual work such as a text, archive item or picture; or a grouping of individual works (so, for instance, an archive collection counts as a work, as do all the series and individual files within it).  Each work may exist in multiple instances (e.g. copies of the same book).  N.B. this is not synonymous with \\\"work\\\" as that is understood in the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions' Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records model (FRBR) but represents something lower down the FRBR hierarchy, namely manifestation. Groups of related items are also included as works because they have similar properties to the individual ones."
