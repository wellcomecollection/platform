    "# A couple of brief notes on how archives store information\n",
    "Archives are arranged in a really interesting way - they're roughly hierarchical trees (with some more graphy elements when you get close to the leaf nodes). Each node contains multiple free-text notes fields which provide descriptions of the common features of their children (this applies even at leaf node level - an _item_ in the hierarchy is usually a box containing multiple _pieces_ of physical material, ie multiple letters or multiple notebook pages). The tree doesn't _necessarily_ describe the arrangememt of nested items in physical space; The tree is more like an _informational_ hierarchy where sections, series and items are gathered conceptually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds great in theory but, as we saw in the last notebook, the tree-based structure makes it difficult to jump quickly from a leaf node in one branch of the hierarchy to another (conceptually related) leaf existing in another branch. Making the jump between the nodes would involve traversing up the tree to (at least) the point where the branches split, and then travelling all the way back down to the related leaf. That journey also requires perfect knowledge of the tree's structure and an understanding of the complete context. While archivists do a good job arranging items into conceptual hierarchies, information is incredibly messy medium to work with and its full complexity often can't be ecapsulated by the tree structure. Archivists therefore often default to the items' _provenance_ as a way of overcoming the problem while conforming to the established guidelines. _Provenance_ refers to the way that the archive material was arranged by its original owner. In this way, archives preserve the owner's usage (a good and valuable thing), but that benefit comes at a cost to users trying to discover information or make connections within/across archives\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wikipedia linking\n",
    "Arriving at a leaf node, it can be hard to find its context within the collection without full tree traversal. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fun idea - wouldn't it be nice to take any arbitrary record from the archive and automatically annotate it with links to relevant wikipedia articles? Can we make our archive records look and feel more like wikipedia pages?  \n",
    "Wikipedia's strength is in its internal links - a typical page contains dozens of links to other contextually related pages, allowing users to traverse an endless warren of information. It's a fantastic embodiment of the idealistic early internet - utopian visions of hypertext, linked open data, and . It's a great established model and it _works_, so why not emulate it?   \n",
    "Wellcome has great links with wikipedia/wikimedia/wikidata, and a lot of our digitised material has already ended up on their platform(s). Why not use the incredible graph that is wikidata to enhance our archives, and in turn enhance wikidata when the archive data eventually makes its way there?  \n",
    "Ideally we'll be able to intelligently link all of our own archive data to itself eventually, but we can make a quick, cheap start by tying our records to wikipedia first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading data\n",
    "As usual, we'll start by importing a few useful packages for manipulating and displaying the data, and load up the data itself."
